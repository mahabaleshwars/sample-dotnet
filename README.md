# HackerNews

A .NET MAUI app for displaying the top posts on Hacker News.

This app demonstrates how to use `IAsyncEnumerable` + C# 8.0 to improve performance. Thanks to `IAsyncEnumerable`, the items are added to the list as soon as they're available making the app feel faster and more responsive.

This app also uses the [Text Analytics API](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-bramin) from [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-bramin) to analyze the sentiment of each headline. 
- üòÉ Headline is Happy 
- ‚òπÔ∏è Headline is Sad 
- üòê Headline is Neither Happy or Sad
